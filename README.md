# Find-the-Best-Players-in-NBA-History
The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the USA's premier professional men’s basketball
league. The NBA has 30 teams; 29 in the United States and one in Canada. The NBA is one of the four
major North American professional sports leagues which are NBA, NHL, NFL and MLB. Now you are
asked to write a program that can find the best players in NBA history. How do many NBA coaches
quickly evaluate a player's game performance? They check the efficiency scores of players.
The problem aims to let you practice how to smartly store and process text files. You will practice
the manipulation of either the list data structure. We provide you a csv file (nba_data.csv) that
contains the raw NBA statistic data of all the players from 1946 to 2009. You are asked to write a
program to compute the career efficiency for all the players, and output the 20 highest efficiency
players in terms of career efficiency.
The format of nba_data.csv is easy to understand. The first line tells you the names of all columns.
From the second line, each line’s data corresponds to one player’s different field values in a particular
regular season. For example, suppose Michael Jordan had played multiple seasons, his data contains
multiple lines for his seasons. You should note that if Michael Jordan had played for two different
teams (for example: Chicago Bulls and LA Lakers) in season 1990, there will be two lines for his data
in season 1990, in which two lines correspond to his data in Bulls and Lakers respectively. In this case,
your program should first sum up the value of each column to obtain the total value in a season. For
example, suppose Michael Jordan made 1800 points (pts) in Chicago Bulls in season 1990 and made
900 points (pts) in LA Lakers in season 1990. Then his total point made in season 1990 is 2700.
